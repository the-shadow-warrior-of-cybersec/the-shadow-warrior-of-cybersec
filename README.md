## 🛡️ About Me

I’m passionate about **Offensive Security, Penetration Testing and Red Team operations**.

I continuously sharpen my skills through CTF competitions, hands-on labs, and building my own security tools/scripts.  

My goal is to **join a professional Red Team** where I can contribute to realistic attack simulations and help organizations strengthen their defenses.

I'm here to make the Internet a better and safer place.
